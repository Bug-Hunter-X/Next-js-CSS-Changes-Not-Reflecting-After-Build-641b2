# Next.js CSS Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where CSS changes in a Next.js application are not reflected after running `next build` and `next start`.  The issue stems from a combination of factors related to Next.js's static site generation and CSS import strategies.

## Problem Description:

Modifications to CSS files were not updated in the browser even after clearing the cache and restarting the development server.

## Solution:

The solution involves ensuring proper CSS import mechanisms within Next.js are utilized and that any caching mechanisms are bypassed effectively.  The specific solution is detailed in `bugSolution.js`.
