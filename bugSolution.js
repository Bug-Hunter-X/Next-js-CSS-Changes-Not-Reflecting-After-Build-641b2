The issue was resolved by using the `next/image` component for images instead of directly importing the image using the `img` tag. Using the `next/image` component ensures the image is optimized and correctly handled by Next.js's build process, thereby resolving the issue of the image not loading correctly. Additionally, cleaning the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` was done to ensure that all necessary dependencies were correctly installed.
